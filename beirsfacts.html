	<h1>Hi! My name is Beir</h1>
	<p>I am a girl golden retriever and I love to get treats, play outside, and terrorize the cat and bunny I live with</p>
	<h2>How I found my master</h2>
	<p>One rainy day me and my brother didnt know what to do when our old masters left us. We were scared, cold and hungry. But luckily we found shelter underneath our masters home. Master found me and ever since ive never been happier!! My brother lives with my masters uncle now where he gets lots of love. But my masters still better!</p>
	<h2>Facts about me</h2>
	<p>I shed way too much...my master says its a problem. Sometimes I see treats that my master leaves behind and I just can help myself cause im kind of a fat fat, or at least thats what master calls me, but he says its okay its just fluff. Also I really love to do what my master calls, "the zoomies". I just like to run after I poop is all. Above all I love my master and he loves me too and im happy with life. </p>
